## About

This repository contains my web development projects, showcasing work completed during my university studies, personal hobby projects, and projects developed during my internship at Splendex Kft.

## Projects

- **University Projects**: Projects completed as part of my coursework. The two relevant classes I took were client-side web development and web programming, both of which are outside the mandatory curriculum.
  
- **Hobby Projects**: A personal project that reflects my interests and skills outside of formal education. It uses JavaScript to create a web game involving a grid and cards. The project is a work in progress that I began to challenge myself and practice coding.

- **Internship Projects**: Work completed during my internship at Splendex Kft, highlighting my practical experience in a professional environment. Each folder displays a project made using a specific programming language. **React.js** had several different tasks due to its importance. One notable project is **"event-planner,"** an extensive full-stack website that requires a MySQL database to run locally.
